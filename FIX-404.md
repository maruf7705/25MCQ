# ✅ Fix for "Failed to load question files: 404"

## Problem
The `public/question-files.json` manifest file exists locally but **hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet**, so Vercel can't find it.

## Solution: Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Check what needs to be pushed
git status

# If you see "Your branch is ahead", push it
git push origin main
```

## If Git Push Asks for Authentication

### Option 1: Use GitHub Desktop (Easiest)
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. It will show "Push origin" button
3. Click it - done!

### Option 2: Command Line with Token
If you get 403 error, you need to authenticate:

1. **Generate Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select: `repo` (full control)
   - Copy the token

2. **Push with Token**:
   ```bash
   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/maruf7705/25MCQ.git main
   ```

### Option 3: SSH Key (Recommended for future)
Set up SSH key once: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

## After Pushing

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for Vercel to auto-deploy
2. **Check your Vercel dashboard** - you should see a new deployment
3. **Test the admin panel** - settings modal should now work!

## Verify Files Were Pushed

Check these files exist on GitHub:
- https://github.com/maruf7705/25MCQ/blob/main/public/question-files.json
- https://github.com/maruf7705/25MCQ/blob/main/api/list-question-files.js
- https://github.com/maruf7705/25MCQ/blob/main/api/get-active-question-file.js
- https://github.com/maruf7705/25MCQ/blob/main/api/set-active-question-file.js

## Quick Test After Deployment

1. Go to your Vercel URL
2. Go to `/admin`
3. Click settings icon (⚙️)
4. Modal should open with question files listed
5. If still 404, check Vercel logs for errors

## Still Getting 404?

### Check Vercel Deployment Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click on latest deployment
4. Check "Functions" tab
5. Look for errors in `list-question-files`

### Manual Verification
Test the API directly in your browser:
```
https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL/api/list-question-files
```

You should see JSON with your question files.
